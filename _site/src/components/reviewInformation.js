                Yale ITS has conducted a review of the website listed above. Our
                accessibility review evaluates conformance to the WCAG 2 AA
                accessibility standard. The review is limited by the scope
                described below and may not be intended to be a complete audit.
                We may recommend expert review to assess the website for full
                conformance with WCAG 2 AA.
              </p>

                The following page(s) contains a description of the scope and a
                list of accessibility issues that were identified during the
                spot check of the above site. If appropriate, Reviewer's Notes
                will be present to provide further clarification or
                recommendations. For each accessibility issue, the following
                information is provided:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>An item number for reference</li>
                <li>A description of the issue</li>
                <li>A prioritization of the issue:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    “Critical” priority issues may interfere with any use of the
                    page whatsoever (typically, critical priority issues are
                    limited to those relating to WCAG 2 criteria 1.4.2, 2.1.2,
                    2.2.2, and 2.3.1, as outlined in section 5.2.5 of WCAG 2.1)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “High” priority issues may prevent the use of particular
                    content on the page
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “Medium” priority issues may substantially interfere with
                    the use of particular content on the page
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “Low” priority issues may interfere somewhat with the use of
                    particular content on the page
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
